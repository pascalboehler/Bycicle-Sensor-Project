## What is this project about?
Our mission is to make the streets of our city a safer place. We try to achieve this aim by creating and deploying a distance warning sensor for bikers.

## How does the sensor works?
Our sensor works with one ultra sonic sensor which can by mounted on your bike. If a car comes nearer than 1,5 meters (the minimal distance allowed in germany), we will give you an acoustic and visual warning, that will inform you about the dangerous situation.
